Boot Camp Pre Work Study Guide for Students

## Description

The study guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through the prework. It contains notes on HTML,CSS, Git and Javascript
I built this project so that me and other students could review notes that I had taken in my prework studies. This allows me to store all my notes in one place so that it is easy to refer back to whilst going through the bootcamp.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
